# Introduction
## What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI) ?
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term  may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex.

     The goals of artificial intelligence include |learning | reasoning | and perception.

## Applications of Artificial Intelligence
The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in    the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room. Other examples of machines with    artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as    each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external      data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.

Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual        debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make   trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.

## Categorization of Artificial Intelligence
    **Artificial Narrow Intelligence(_ANI_, Weak AI) | Artificial General Intelligence(_AGI_, **Strong AI**) | Artificial Super Intelligence(_ASI_, **Strongest AI**) 
    
    Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex and human-like. Artificial Super Intelligence is the stage of Artificial Intelligence when the capability of computers will surpass human beings

Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, Self-driving cars, Alpha-Go, Sophia the humanoid and so on. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you. Almost all the AI-based systems built till this date fall under the category of Weak AI.

Strong AI systems are systems that are considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervention. AGI is the stage in the evolution of Artificial Intelligence wherein machines will possess the ability to think and make decisions just like us humans.There are currently no existing examples of Strong AI, however, it is believed that we will soon be able to create machines that are as smart as humans.

Strong AI is considered a threat to human existence by many scientists, including *Stephen Hawking who stated that:
>“The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race…. It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded.”

Artificial Super Intelligence is the stage of Artificial Intelligence when the capability of computers will surpass human beings. ASI is currently a hypothetical situation as depicted in movies and science fiction books, where machines have taken over the world.

## How many types of AI are there ?
    reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.
