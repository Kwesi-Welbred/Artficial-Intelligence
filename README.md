# Introduction
## What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI) ?
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term  may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex.

     The goals of artificial intelligence include |learning | reasoning | and perception.

## Applications of Artificial Intelligence
The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in    the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room. Other examples of machines with    artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as    each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external      data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.

Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual        debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make   trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.

## Categorization of Artificial Intelligence
    **Artificial Narrow Intelligence(_ANI_, Weak AI) | Artificial General Intelligence(_AGI_, **Strong AI**) | Artificial Super Intelligence(_ASI_, **Strongest AI**) 
    
    Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex and human-like. Artificial Super Intelligence is the stage of Artificial Intelligence when the capability of computers will surpass human beings

Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, Self-driving cars, Alpha-Go, Sophia the humanoid and so on. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you. Almost all the AI-based systems built till this date fall under the category of Weak AI.

Strong AI systems are systems that are considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervention. AGI is the stage in the evolution of Artificial Intelligence wherein machines will possess the ability to think and make decisions just like us humans.There are currently no existing examples of Strong AI, however, it is believed that we will soon be able to create machines that are as smart as humans.

Strong AI is considered a threat to human existence by many scientists, including *Stephen Hawking who stated that:
>“The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race…. It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded.”

Artificial Super Intelligence is the stage of Artificial Intelligence when the capability of computers will surpass human beings. ASI is currently a hypothetical situation as depicted in movies and science fiction books, where machines have taken over the world.

## How many types of AI are there ?
    reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.
 
 1. Reactive Machine AI:
This type of AI includes machines that operate solely based on the present data, taking into account only the current situation. Reactive AI machines cannot form inferences from the data to evaluate their future actions. They can perform a narrowed range of pre-defined tasks. An example of Reactive AI is the famous IBM Chess program that beat the world champion, *Garry Kasparov.

2. Limited Memory AI :
Like the name suggests Limited Memory AI, can make informed and improved decisions by studying the past data from its memory. Such an AI has a short-lived or a temporary memory that can be used to store past experiences and hence evaluate future actions. Self-driving cars are Limited Memory AI, that uses the data collected in the recent past to make immediate decisions. For example, self-driving cars use sensors to identify civilians crossing the road, steep roads, traffic signals and so on to make better driving decisions. This helps to prevent any future accidents.

3. Theory Of Mind AI :
The Theory Of Mind AI is a more advanced type of Artificial Intelligence. This category of machines is speculated to play a major role in psychology. This type of AI will focus mainly on emotional intelligence so that human believes and thoughts can be better comprehended. The Theory of Mind AI has not yet been fully developed but rigorous research is happening in this area.

4. Self-Aware AI :
Let’s just pray that we don’t reach the state of AI, where machines have their own consciousness and become self-aware. This type of AI is a little far fetched given the present circumstances. However, in the future, achieving a stage of superintelligence might be possible.


## Branches Of Artifical Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence can be used to solve real-world problems by implementing the following processes/ techniques:

     Machine Learning Deep Learning | Natural Language Processing | Robotics | Expert Systems | Fuzzy Logic
     
1. Machine Learning:
  Machine Learning is the science of getting machines to interpret, process and analyze data in order to solve real-world problems. Under Machine Learning there
  are three categories:
     1. Supervised Learning
     2. Unsupervised Learning
     3. Reinforcement Learning

2. Deep Learning :
Deep Learning is the process of implementing Neural Networks on high dimensional data to gain insights and form solutions. Deep Learning is an advanced field of Machine Learning that can be used to solve more advanced problems.
Deep Learning is the logic behind the face verification algorithm on Facebook, self-driving cars, virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa and so on.

3. Natural Language Processing : 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the science of drawing insights from natural human language in order to communicate with machines and grow businesses.
Twitter uses NLP to filter out terroristic language in their tweets, Amazon uses NLP to understand customer reviews and improve user experience.

4. Robotics : 
Robotics is a branch of Artificial Intelligence which focuses on different branches and application of robots. AI Robots are artificial agents acting in a real-world environment to produce results by taking accountable actions. :pouting_face: Sophia the humanoid is a good example of AI in robotics.

5. Fuzzy Logic :
Fuzzy logic is a computing approach based on the principles of “degrees of truth” instead of the usual modern computer logic i.e. boolean in nature. Fuzzy logic is used in the medical fields to solve complex problems that involve decision making. They are also used in automatic gearboxes, vehicle environment control and so on.

6. Expert Systems
An expert system is an AI-based computer system that learns and reciprocates the decision-making ability of a human expert. Expert systems use if-then logical notations to solve complex problems. It does not rely on conventional procedural programming. Expert systems are mainly used in information management, medical facilities, loan analysis, virus detection and so on.
